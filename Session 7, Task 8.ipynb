    "* C/C++ Languages Now Include Multithreading Libraries\n",
    "Moving from single-threaded programs to multithreaded increases complexity. Programming languages, such as C and C++, have evolved to make it easier to use multiple threads and handle this complexity. Both C and C++ now include threading libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern C++, in particular, has gone a long way to make parallel programming easier. C++11 included a standard threading library. C++17 added parallel algorithms â€” and parallel implementations of many standard algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional support for parallelism is expected in future versions of C++\n"
