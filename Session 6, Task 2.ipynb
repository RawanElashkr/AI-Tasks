    "                                               Devops Tools\n",
    "While DevOps is a culture, the right stack of tools makes it possible to implement DevOps successfully. At its core and perhaps the most remarkable concept that the DevOps approach ever brought is the collaboration between the software development and operations teams. Also and importantly, the DevOps approach emphasis is on the automation of software development processes like build, test, incident detection and response, release, and others to yield a faster time-to-market, high-quality products, and reduced failures and rollbacks of software/software features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, DevOps is today more than a collaborative culture and software development automation. It integrates emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing. Far too many exceptional DevOps tool(s) for build, version control, configuration management, project management, incident management, and more have been developed. However, in this DevOps course, we shall examine only a few top tools under various DevOps processes and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Version Control Tool: Git (GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket)\n",
    "Git is perhaps the best and most widely used version control tool in a development era characterized by dynamism and collaboration. Version control provides developers with a means by which they can keep track of all the changes and updates in their codes such that in the event of a mishap, it is quite easy to return to and use the previous versions of the code and Git happens to be the best for many reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git DevOps tool is easy to implement as it is compatible with most protocols including HTTP, SSH, and FTP. It offers the best advantage for non-linear shared-repository development projects, unlike most other centralized version control tools. This makes it a good deal for mission-critical software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git features three storage tools including, GitHub and GitLab cloud-hosted code repository services as well as BitBucket the source code hosting service. Of the three, GitLab and BitBucket are specifically designed for enterprise-range version control\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build Tool: Maven\n",
    "Maven is one of the important DevOps tools for building projects. Unlike the ANT build system, Apache Maven is more than just an automation build framework. It is also designed to manage reporting, documentation, distribution, releases, and dependencies processes. Written in Java language, Maven can build and manage projects written in Java or C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages using project object model (POM) plugins. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maven offers a host of benefits to its users. It eases the build and monitoring process through automation and maintains a uniform build process allowing for consistency and efficiency. This tool also offers comprehensive project information through quality documentation, a valuable resource for the development of best practices hence the name Maven, translated from the Yiddish language to mean accumulator of knowledge. Finally, Maven provides a very simplified feature migration process. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has a rich repository of plugins to enhance the build process and wide compatibility with IDEs like Eclipse, JBuilder, MyEclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Continuous Integration Tool: Jenkins\n",
    "Jenkins is an integration DevOps tool. For continuous integration (CI), Jenkins stands out as it is designed for both internal and plugin extensions. Jenkins is an open-source Java-based automation CI server that is supported by multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and other Unix OSs. Jenkins can also be deployed on cloud-based platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are two core practices of the DevOps methodology which makes Jenkins an indispensable DevOps tool. Jenkins is compatible with most CI/CD integration tools and services thanks to the over 1,500 plugins available to provide integration points for delivering customized functionality during software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "A valuable automation CI tool, Jenkins is pretty easy to install and configure. It is designed to support distributed workflows for accelerated and transparent builds, tests, and deployments across platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Configuration Management Tool: Chef\n",
    "Configuration management (CM) refers to the maintenance and control of the components of large complex systems in a known, consistent, and determined state throughout the DevOps life cycle. Components of an IT system may include servers, networks, storage, and applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, configuration management is critical to any system as it is the process by which changes in the system are tracked, properly implemented, and controlled. Further, if not automated, CM can be laborious, resource-draining, and prone to costly errors. It implements configuration tools for such repetitive administrative tasks as version management, regulatory compliance, feature releases, and processes automation, among others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Chef, Puppet, and Ansible are handy CM automation frameworks. While Chef and Puppet are Ruby-based frameworks, Ansible is a Python-based framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chef, an open-source framework, uses a master-agent model and has infrastructure as code (IAC) capabilities to automate the configuration of infrastructure. Together with its multi-platform support that includes the cloud platform, Chef remains one of the most popular DevOps tools after Puppet. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Configuration Management Tool: Puppet\n",
    "Puppet is also open-source and uses declarative programming for system configuration, deployments, and server management DevOps tools. It is organized into reusable modules for the speedy setup of pre-configured servers and is compatible with most platforms. Like Chef, it also uses IAC, adopts a master-slave architecture, and features an intuitive user interface for ease of real-time reporting, node management, and several other tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Configuration Management Tool: Ansible\n",
    "Ansible is an open-source CM DevOps tool that is also used for deployment, automation, and orchestration. While Ansible leverages infrastructure as a code architecture, it uses SSH connection for its push nodes thus agentless. Of the three, Ansible is considered easy to learn and use as its Playbooks are written in YAML with minimal commands and are readable by humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes, Docker and Kubernetes DevOps tools\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Container Platforms: Docker\n",
    "Container platforms are application solutions that allow developers to build, test, and ship applications in resource-independent environments. Each container comprises a complete runtime environment including the specific application, its libraries, source code, configurations, and all its dependencies. Container platforms offer orchestration, automation, security, governance, and other capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DevOps heavily relies on containerization and microservices for efficient application development and deployment with Docker and Kubernetes as the most widely used container technologies. \n",
