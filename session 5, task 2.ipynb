    "A graph is a binary relation. It provides a powerful visualization as a set of points (called nodes) connected by lines (called edges) or arrows (called arcs). In this regard, the graph is a generalization of the tree data model. Like trees, graphs come in several forms: directed, undirected and labeled.\n",
    "Directed vs Undirected Graphs\n",
    "A undirected graph means that the relationship along an edge between two nodes is bidirectional, i.e. it can go either way. A directed graph means that the relationship only goes one way.\n",
    "Undirected graphs are typically represented by a line with no arrows, which imply a bidirectional relationship between node A and node B. Directed graphs use an arrow to show the relationship from A to B.\n",
    "Minimal Description of the Graph Data Type\n",
    "As an abstract type, we can view a graph as a collection of elements that are stored at the graph's edges and nodes (nodes are also sometimes referred to as vertices). The essential methods we need for dealing with graphs will be the following:\n",

    "A common way to implement a graph using an adjacency list is to use either a hashtable with an array as values or use a hashtable with linked lists as a value. Since Python combines the idea of arrays and linked lists, we can easily implement this representation using a dictionary with nodes as keys and a list as a value.\n",
