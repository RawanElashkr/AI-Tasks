    "Hash Tables are an essential data structure for efficiently storing and retrieving data in Python. They are used in many applications, including databases, search engines, and caching systems. With a good understanding of how Hash Tables work, you can make use of this powerful tool in your own programs\n",
    "A Hash Table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that stores keys and values and uses a hash function to map the key to an index in an array, where the corresponding value can be quickly retrieved. In technical terms, a Hash Table is an implementation of an associative array abstract data type, with constant average time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash Tables in Python, are implemented as dictionaries. Dictionaries use a hash table to store the keys and values and provide fast access to the values based on the keys. To create a dictionary in Python, you can use curly braces {} and separate the keys and values with colons. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "d = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n",
    "In this example, the keys “key1” and “key2” are mapped to the values “value1” and “value2” respectively. To retrieve the value associated with a key, you can use square brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "value = d['key1'] # value is 'value1'\n",
    "In Python, dictionaries use a technique called “hashing” to map keys to indices in the underlying array. This means that the average time complexity of the basic operations (insertion, deletion, and search) is constant, which makes dictionaries highly efficient for many use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that dictionaries are not ordered by default. If you need to maintain the order of thekey-value pairs, you can use an OrderedDict instead. An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted into it. You can create an OrderedDict in Python like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "from collections import OrderedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "d = OrderedDict()\n",
    "d['key1'] = 'value1'\n",
    "d['key2'] = 'value2'\n",
    " hash function is a special mathematical tool that takes in some information and creates a unique, fixed-length code from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a secret code that only the computer can understand. This code is called a “hash value.” The hash function always creates the same hash value for the same information. But it’s impossible to figure out what the original information was just by looking at the hash value. This makes hash functions useful for things like checking if the information hasn’t been changed, or for creating passwords that are secure and can’t be easily figured out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions are widely used for various purposes, such as ensuring data integrity, generating digital signatures, and for implementing data structures like hash tables. They are also used in password management systems, where the password is transformed into a hash value before it is stored in a database, so that it can be compared with the hash value of the entered password at a later time to determine if the password is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of these properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic:\n",
    "This means that if you put the same information through the hash function, you’ll get the same result every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-invertible:\n",
    "It’s not possible to turn the result of a hash function (the “hash value”) back into the original information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-Size Output:\n",
    "The output of the hash function will always be the same length and number of characters, no matter what kind of information was put in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique Output:To create a Hash Table in most programming languages, you need to take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the size of the Hash Table (the number of indices in the underlying array).\n",
    "Create a hash function that takes a key as input and returns an index in the array.\n",
    "Create an array with the specified size and initialize it with empty values.\n",
    "Implement functions to add, delete, and retrieve values based on keys.\n",
    "Here’s an example of how to create a Hash Table in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class HashTable:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, size):\n",
    "        self.size = size\n",
    "        self.table = [[] for _ in range(self.size)]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def hash_function(self, key):\n",
    "        return hash(key) % self.size\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def set(self, key, value):\n",
    "        index = self.hash_function(key)\n",
    "        self.table[index].append((key, value))\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def get(self, key):\n",
    "        index = self.hash_function(key)\n",
    "        for k, v in self.table[index]:\n",
    "            if k == key:\n",
    "                return v\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "The result of the hash function will be different for different inputs, even if just a small part of the information is different. This is called the “avalanche effect.”"
